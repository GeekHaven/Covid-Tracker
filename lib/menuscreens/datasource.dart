          "question":"Can COVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms ?",
          "answer": "The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. "

While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. However, it's better to clean hands regularly,after using the bathroom and before eating to avoid the risk. "
